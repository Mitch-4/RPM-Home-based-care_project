# RPM-Home-based-care_project

This is an AI-powered remote health monitoring and emergency response system for home-based care.
It leverages non-contact mmWave sensing (C1001) to track vitals such as **heart rate, respiration, and movement**, providing real-time dashboards for both doctors and caregivers. The system is designed to empower home-based caregivers with timely alerts, patient monitoring, and emergency response capabilities.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* **`npm start`**
  Runs the app in development mode.
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

  The page will reload when changes are made.
  You may also see lint errors in the console.

* **`npm test`**
  Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
  See the [running tests guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

* **`npm run build`**
  Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.
  React is bundled in production mode, and the build is optimized for performance.
  The build is minified, and filenames include hashes.

* **`npm run eject`**
  **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
  Ejecting gives you full control over the build configuration (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc).
